This ETL project was to set up a database of the required data to analyse the profitability of crypto mining. With each GPU has different efficiency to which algorithm they are using, there are 100s of combinations that could fit into your budget and see which combination of crypto and GPUs is the most profitable. 
The main customer that would target this data are Current Crypto miner, starting up Miner, Starting up crypto investor, General investor. 
Not only the coin prices fluctuates but GPUs also fluctuates in prices and technology. Mining requirements for each coins are also different e.g. GPU RTX 3060 is compatible to mine ETH, ARK but not CAD, BTC.
